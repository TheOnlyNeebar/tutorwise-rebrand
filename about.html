    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <section class="story">
      <p><strong>TutorWise</strong> began in 2006 as a home-based tutoring center known as <strong>Diviya Tutoring</strong>. Our roots were built on a deep love for education and a commitment to supporting the local community. Over the years, we’ve proudly supported hundreds of families in Brampton, helping students from all backgrounds reach their full academic potential.</p>
      <p>As our community grew, so did we — evolving into TutorWise and moving to our dedicated location on Automatic Road. What started with living room whiteboards and dining room desks has become a trusted education hub, known for a warm, personal, and results-driven approach to learning.</p>
      <p>Families who’ve been with us remember our holiday parties, fun summer camps, and lasting bonds. These aren’t just tutoring sessions — they’re stepping stones in a student’s journey. From IEP learners to high achievers, we treat every student as an individual.</p>
      <p>At TutorWise, we believe in the power of a strong education. We know that academic results speak louder than words — and we’re proud to say our students consistently show growth, improved grades, and new confidence in themselves.</p>
